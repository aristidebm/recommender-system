## Algorithms

### Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

**ALS** is a collaborative filtering technique based on **matrix factorization**. It models user and item interactions by discovering latent features that explain observed ratings. The algorithm alternates between optimizing user and item matrices to minimize the regularized objective function:

$$
\min_{U, V} \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ij} - U_i^T V_j)^2 + \lambda (||U||^2 + ||V||^2)
$$

Where:
- \( U \): Matrix of user latent factors (\( n \times k \)).
- \( V \): Matrix of item latent factors (\( m \times k \)).
- \( r_{ij} \): Observed rating for user \( i \) and item \( j \).
- \( \lambda \): Regularization term to prevent overfitting.

#### Workflow:
1. Fix item matrix \( V \), optimize user matrix \( U \).
2. Fix user matrix \( U \), optimize item matrix \( V \).
3. Repeat until convergence.

#### Advantages:
- Scalable to large datasets.
- Handles sparsity in user-item interaction matrices effectively.

## Dataset

The system utilizes the [**MovieLens dataset**](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which includes:
- **Users**: Unique IDs representing users.
- **Items**: Unique IDs representing items (e.g., movies).
- **Ratings**: User-item interactions (e.g., 1-5 stars).

This dataset is a standard benchmark for evaluating recommendation algorithms.

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hjisaac/recommender-system.git
   cd recommender-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   To run the movielenz example, download the dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

---

## Usage

1. **Run the model**:
   Run the example file:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate performance**:
   The script outputs RMSE values for both training and testing, providing insight into the system's predictive accuracy.

---

## Performance

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is used as the primary evaluation metric:

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ij} - \hat{r}_{ij})^2}
$$

Where:
- \( r_{ij} \): Actual rating.
- \( \hat{r}_{ij} \): Predicted rating.

### Results (Example)
- **Training RMSE**: 0.84
- **Test RMSE**: 0.88

These results demonstrate the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, confirming its practical applicability.

---

## Improvements

- **Integration of Additional Algorithms**: Incorporate other collaborative filtering and content-based methods.
- **Hybrid Recommender Systems**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved performance.
- **More Examples**: Implement more examples potentially with different datasets for real-time recommendations.
- **Numba and Jax**: Currently it is not possible to use numba/jax, cause the code contains a lot of custom objects. Plan a fix.
- **Issues**: Resolve the remaining issues and compare with existing library.
